# Calculation of Rrs and Kd based on Radiometric Quantities from TriOS-RAMSES data.


This package will calculate the Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs) and Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient of Downward Irradiance (Kd)
based on measurements of radiometric quantities using TriOS-RAMSES data. For Rrs calculation the method of Mobley (2015) is used 
wheres for Kd calculation the method describe by Mishra et al. (2005) is used. 

For usage of this package users could clone this repository and run the rrs_calculation.R or kd_calculation.R scripts.
